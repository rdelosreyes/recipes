Ingredients:
- 1 kg tomatoes
- 200 gr of white bread
- 1 clove of garlic (or more if you like the garlic a lot)
- olive oil and salt (as if you would dress a salad)
- 2 eggs
- serrano jam or other salty sausage

Peel the tomatoes and mix them with the bread, the olive oil, the salt and the garlic. Add more/less bread if you want a thinner/denser salmorejo, and more or less garlic/oil/salt until you find it tasty. It always depends on taste.

Boil the eggs around 15-20 min.. Cut them, add the salty sausage, in small pieces. Put the cut pieces on top of the salmorejo when you serve it.
